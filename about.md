title: About

i'm a researcher (working in healthcare). I try to consume content — books, papers, posts, podcasts, whatever — and started writing to figure out what I actually think about it all.
This is writing from the edge of understanding. Hopefully, less about "here's what I know" and more about "here's what I'm trying to work out." Rough edges included.
