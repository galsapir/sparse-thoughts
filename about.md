There's something about writing things down that makes them stick. Thoughts that seem clear in your head turn out to be half-formed when you try to put them into words. This is a place to pin down those half-formed ideas and see what they actually look like.

It's deliberately low-commitment: things I've been reading, things I've been thinking about, occasional attempts to make sense of it all. Built to be under the radar, low friction, minimal effort.

If you're expecting polish, you're in the wrong place.
