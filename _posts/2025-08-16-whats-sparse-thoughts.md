title: What's Sparse Thoughts?
description: "Introduction to Sparse Thoughts—a low-friction space for collecting and reflecting on interesting content."

For a while now I've been collecting too many things to read and think about, mostly in twitter 'saved links'. 
This is a place for me to silently collect together things I enjoyed reading / other content I've enjoyed and sometimes jot some thoughts about it. It's built in a way that won't make me feel too committed, should be kind of under the radar, low friction, minimal effort.
