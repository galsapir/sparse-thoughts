One of the things that has been really hot lalely (and not only lately) is context. 
I recently enjoyed [this read](https://petrapalusova.com/articles/contextengineering) which makes a lot of sense.
It echoes a lot of the same thoughts I had recently about what *really* is our role in this collaboration with AI - what is the human edge, and what types of human thinking are important right now [^1]. 
[^1] I can't write about context and not mention [this post](marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/02/context-is-that-which-is-scarce-2.html).
